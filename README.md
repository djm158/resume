# LaTeX resume

template from [LaTeX Templates](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/medium-length-professional-cv)
original author: [Trey Hunner](http://treyhunner.com/)

## Build

Travis builds my resume via [tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/en-US/) in a docker container described in detail [here](https://github.com/PHPirates/travis-ci-latex-pdf#1-docker-image-with-tectonic)

You can clone this repository and use my resume as a template. If you choose not to clone this repository and instead use the original from latextemplates.com, it is important the file `resume.cls` is in the same directory as your `.tex` file.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/djm158/resume
```
